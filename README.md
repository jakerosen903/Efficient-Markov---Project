# Efficient-Markov---Project

An order-k Markov model uses strings of k-letters to predict text, these are called k-grams. It's also possible to use k-grams that are comprised of words rather than letters. An order-2 Markov model uses two-character strings or bigrams to calculate probabilities in generating random letters. A string called the training text is used to calculate the possibilities.
